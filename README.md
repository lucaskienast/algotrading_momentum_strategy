# algotrading_momentum_strategy
 This is a simple momentum trading strategy written in Python. It works as follows:  load market data, resample adjusted prices, compute log returns, shift returns, generate trading signal for best and worst 'n' performers, compute projected returns, annualise rate of return, perform one-sided t-test to see if null hypothesis (mean return is zero) can be rejected
